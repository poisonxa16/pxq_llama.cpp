# bench/fair/run.sh — wires the existing bench harnesses to the bench/fair/protocol.md rules.
# Does NOT implement a new benchmark: it verifies weights, then calls ../speed-bench.sh (and,
# where applicable, ../measure.py) exactly as they exist today. Where those scripts cannot
# produce a protocol-compliant number, this script says "not automated yet" rather than
# reporting a number measured under a looser protocol as if it were one of the three.
#
# Usage:
#   cd bench/fair
#   PRODUCT_MODEL=/path/to/fusion2-35b-U16-q8head.gguf \
#   CODEC_A_MODEL=/path/to/PXA-Fusion2-35B-PXQ6.gguf \
#   CODEC_B_MODEL=/path/to/some-mxfp4-equivalent.gguf \
#   ./run.sh
#
# Every model env var above is optional; a number that has no model wired prints
# "not automated yet" instead of being skipped silently.
