# CARD MAP, in PCI_BUS_ID order (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES orders FASTEST-FIRST otherwise, which
# would silently renumber everything):
#   0 P100  <- also carries a production granite seat, ~8.4 GiB already resident
#   1 P100
#   2 V100
#   3 GTX 1080 Ti  <- PRODUCTION VLM + embeddings. NEVER included.
#   4 V100

#   6 P100
#
# Why per_layer_token_embd goes to the CPU: it is 160 x 320,001,536 in IQ4_NL, about 28.8 GiB,
# and it is a pure GET_ROWS table - a gather per token per head, no GEMM. Keeping it in host
# RAM costs a PCIe gather and frees nearly a third of the file from VRAM. The remaining ~38 GiB
# of weights sit comfortably in the ~87 GiB the six cards have free.
#
# The -ot pattern is ANCHORED. A loose 'ple' regex would also match blk.1's ple_key,
# ple_conv1d and three F32 ple_norm_* tensors, which must stay on the GPU.

# Card 0 shares with a production seat, so it takes a smaller slice.
#
# -ts partitions BYTES, not layer counts (llama.cpp:4071-4100 walks layer_sizes[] against
# splits[id]*sum, with a max_compute allowance added per device). These six numbers are
# therefore a byte budget per card, and they land the 48 layers + output head as
#   4 / 7 / 11 / 11 / 7 / 8+head   over CUDA0..CUDA5 = P100,P100,V100,V100,P100,P100.
#
# That is four layers moved off the P100s onto the two V100s, which is the whole prize:
# post-load headroom is 2 layers per V100 (a layer is 1341 MiB; 11 layers leaves 1095 MiB
# free on a 16 GiB V100), so 12 would not load. The V100s run a layer 0.28 ms/token cheaper
# than the P100s, and because the six cards serialize with literally zero overlap (measured:
# summed kernel busy == union of busy intervals), every microsecond saved on any card comes
# straight off the critical path.
#
# Measured, 127 tokens per arm, three interleaved repeats each:
#   4/9/9/9/9/8+head  34.38, 34.20, 34.47 ms/token  (29.09, 29.24, 29.01 tok/s)
#   4/7/11/11/7/8     33.25, 32.94, 33.04 ms/token  (30.08, 30.35, 30.27 tok/s)
# -1.27 ms/token, -3.70%, no overlap between the two sets. nsys per-kernel capture predicted
# -1.114 ms/token from the same placement, so the wall clock and the kernel time agree.
