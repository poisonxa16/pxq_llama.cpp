# PXA Network — PXQ4 sm_60 (Tesla P100) serving launcher.
#
# MEASURED shipping configuration. Every arm was correctness-gated AND
# byte-gated (20/20 greedy outputs identical to an NCCL reference boot) before
# its number was recorded. Measured on the box cards 1,6, 2026-08-27:
#
#   gate config (old site, v7 lib, CAR off, custom_ops none)  13.31 single
#   this config                                               24.0-26.4 single
#                                                             70-72 aggregate @8
#                                                             ~218 prefill
#
# WHY EACH VALUE, so none of them get "tidied" away later:
#
#  TORCHDYNAMO_DISABLE=1   LOAD-BEARING. Without it profile_run compiles the
#      LANGUAGE model through Inductor and dies with GPUTooOldForTriton on a
#      capability-6.0 card. This is the single flag that decides whether the
#      server starts at all. Do not remove it to "let dynamo try".
#  CAR left ON            The dominant speed lever: 13.3 -> 24.0, ~1.8x. It is
#      NOT passed --disable-custom-all-reduce. Byte-gated 20/20 against an NCCL
#      reference on this exact lib+site+config, so it is safe HERE. It remains
#      unsafe for MoE models on Pascal -- that is a different model class.
#  custom_ops default     Deliberately NOT "none". "none" is a correctness
#      workaround for a different config: with defaults at MNS=4/ladder[1,2,4]
#      a raw 1-token prompt returns "!!!!" while Paris and 391 still pass. It
#      clears at MNS=8/ladder[1,2,4,8], which is why this config is clean.
#  MNS=8, ladder[1,2,4,8] Both required for the above. MNS=16 is UNVERIFIED on
#      this arch -- its only test ran on a broken image.
#  GMU 0.90               0.94 reintroduces the "!!!!" raw-prompt failure.
#  SPLIT_MAX_BLOCKS=300   NOT 150. 150 is bimodal: four boots gave 24.58,
#      24.61, 19.75 and 9.27. 300 gave 24.01/23.97/23.97 across three. A single
#      good 150 sample looks like a win and is not.
#  PXQ4_MMV_SLICE_MAX=8   Confirmed a dead knob at serving level (14.43 vs
#      14.24 at 16). Kept only to pin it against re-litigation.
#  PXQ4_LIB explicit      The sidecar tree bundles an sm70-only .so built
#      against the torch 2.10 ABI. Unset, the loader can reach it on this
#      image and die on `undefined symbol: ...incref_pyobject...` mid-load.
#  PASCAL_SDPA            Pascal has no tensor cores; FLASH_ATTN_V100 is sm_70.
