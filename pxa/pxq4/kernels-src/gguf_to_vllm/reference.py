"""reference.py — the numpy bit-exactness oracle for PXQ4. Plan §6.3.

This is the single most load-bearing file in the port. Gate G1 pins it against the engine's
own CPU decoder ``pxa_deq_row_pxq6`` (ggml/src/pxq-cpu.c:135-158) by exact fp32 equality;
gate G6 then pins the CUDA extension against this. If G1 passes, the panel arithmetic, slab
offsets, nibble order, table values and multiply order are all correct, which is the bulk of
the port's risk — and none of it needs a GPU.

THE PARITY-LOCKED CONTRACT (pxq-cpu.h:16-18 states it explicitly: the dequant IS the
contract; the GEMM kernels are deliberately NOT bit-exact with it because they snap products
to fp16 inside the MMA):

    eff = float32(anchor_fp16) * SUB[s4]     once per (row, 16-element block)
    w   = eff * float32(BOOK[code])          per element

``eff`` must be formed FIRST, as its own rounded float32 product. Reassociating to
``anchor * (sub * book)`` changes the rounding and breaks bit-exactness against both the C
reference and the CUDA kernel. There is no zero point and no offset: a zero row is
``anchor = fp16(+0)`` and dequantizes to exact zeros everywhere.
