# Converting to PXQU (universal mixed-tier) quants

`PXQ_UNIVERSAL` (a.k.a. PXQU) is a per-tensor mixed quant: instead of one bit-width for the whole model, a
**tier map** assigns a quant type to each expert tensor by name. This lets a large MoE land in a target VRAM
budget by spending bits where they matter (high-importance experts) and squeezing the rest (down to the 1-bit
`pxq1` tier). The result is a model that fits fully GPU-resident on a card it otherwise couldn't.

## The flag

```
llama-quantize --allow-requantize \
  --imatrix <model>.imatrix \
  --override-kv <arch>.expert_used_count=int:<top_k> \
  --pxq-universal <map>.tiers \
  <source-q8>.gguf  <out>.gguf  PXQ_UNIVERSAL  <threads>
```

- `--pxq-universal <map>.tiers` — path to the tier map (format below).
- `--imatrix` — importance matrix for the source model; PXQU leans on it to place bits well.
- `--override-kv …expert_used_count=int:N` — pin the routing to the model's real top-k so the calibration
  matches how the model actually runs.
- Source should be a near-lossless **Q8_0** gguf.

Files containing the `pxq1` (1-bit) tier require a build with the PXQ1 codec (this release); other tiers
(`pxq2/pxq3/pxq4/pxq6`) run on any current build.

## The tier map format

A tier map is a text file of `#`-commented lines, one `regex=type` rule per expert tensor:

```
# <budget> tier map — one rule per expert tensor
^blk\.0\.ffn_gate_exps\.weight$=pxq2
^blk\.0\.ffn_up_exps\.weight$=pxq2
^blk\.0\.ffn_down_exps\.weight$=pxq3
...
```

- The regex is matched against the GGUF tensor name; the type is one of
  `pxq1` / `pxq2` / `pxq3` / `pxq4` / `pxq6`.
- Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored. Tensors with no matching rule fall through to the
  backbone recipe for the requested ftype.
- A bare filename is resolved relative to `$PXA_PXQU_DIR` (default `pxa-bench/pxq-universal/`);
  an absolute or relative path is used as-is.

Write one for your own tensor names and VRAM budget: total the per-tensor byte cost at each tier
(bpw × elements), then spend the budget on the tensors your imatrix says matter most. As reference
points, these are the budget/composition splits behind our published 122B-A5B (48 layers × 256
experts) builds:

| Budget | Composition (experts) | ~Resident |
|---|---|---|
| 24 GB | 126× pxq1 · 18× pxq2 | ~23.5 GiB |
| 32 GB | 61× pxq1 · 57× pxq2 · 26× pxq3 | ~31.7 GiB |
| 48 GB | 61× pxq2 · 57× pxq3 · 26× pxq6 | ~45.8 GiB |

The tighter the budget, the more experts drop to `pxq1`, and the more the aggressive tiers benefit
from a no-think serving posture.

> A mostly-1-bit map is the aggressive edge. Always live-validate after quantizing — coherence is
> the gate.

## Building for 30-series / 40-series (Ampere / Ada)

The release binary already targets `sm_86`/`sm_89`. To build from source for these cards:

```
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="86;89" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

For a mixed fleet, list every arch you run: `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="60;61;70;86;89"` (Pascal → Ada).
The per-arch performance levers auto-select at runtime under `PXA_ENHANCE=1`.
