"""pxq4_moe.py -- PXQ4 FusedMoE quantization method.

This is the engine half of blocker C in 122B-VLLM-FINDINGS.md. Before it,
``PXQ4Config.get_quant_method`` returned ``None`` for every ``FusedMoE`` layer, which
``fused_moe/layer.py:357-358`` turns into ``UnquantizedFusedMoEMethod`` -- i.e. fp16 expert
weights. For the 122B that is 216.0 GiB of expert weight against 63.55 GiB of P100 VRAM, a
3.40x overshoot; for the 35B it is 33.8 GiB against 31.8 GiB. Both are unloadable, so the
whole point of this file is that the experts stay PXQ4 in memory and are decoded per use.

WEIGHT LAYOUT
-------------
vLLM's FusedMoE contract is two stacked parameters per layer:

    w13   [E, 2*I_p, H]     gate and up, concatenated on the output axis (column parallel)
    w2    [E, H,     I_p]   down                                          (row parallel)

``I_p`` is ALREADY the per-rank intermediate size -- vLLM hands ``create_weights`` the sharded
value. Each of those becomes a PXQ4 (slabs, anchor) pair with the expert as a new slowest axis:

    w13_pxq4_slabs  uint8   [E, 2*I_p/64, H/32,   1088]
    w13_pxq4_anchor float16 [E, 2*I_p/64, 64]
    w2_pxq4_slabs   uint8   [E, H/64,     I_p/32, 1088]
    w2_pxq4_anchor  float16 [E, H/64,     64]

SHARDING, AND WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE LEGAL BYTE MOVES
------------------------------------------------------
Column parallel (w13) cuts the OUTPUT axis. A PXQ4 panel is 64 output rows, so the cut is a
whole-panel slice as long as ``I_p % 64 == 0``; the anchor (one fp16 per row) is cut the same
way. Nothing inside a panel is touched.

Row parallel (w2) cuts the CONTRACTION axis. A slab is 64 rows x 32 columns and carries its own
sub-scale, so a K-cut is a whole-slab slice as long as ``I_p % 32 == 0``, and the anchor is
NOT cut -- every rank keeps the full per-output-row anchor and the partial products are summed
by the all-reduce afterwards. That duplication is correct because the anchor is a linear
per-row scale: ``sum_r scale*partial_r == scale * sum_r partial_r``.

Both conditions are asserted in ``create_weights`` rather than assumed, because a silent
truncation here produces a model that loads and generates fluent garbage.

COMPUTE
-------
``apply`` is a per-expert loop, NOT a grouped kernel. For each expert actually routed to in
this batch it gathers that expert's tokens, runs the existing 2-D PXQ4 ops on them, and
scatters the weighted result back. This is deliberately the simple correct thing:

  * it reuses ``pxq4::mmv_out`` / ``pxq4::dequant_out``, which are already validated bit-exact
    against the numpy oracle, so nothing new has to be trusted numerically;
  * it keeps the experts PXQ4 in memory, which is the entire memory argument;
  * it is SLOW -- one kernel launch per routed expert per projection per layer, and a
    host-side ``.tolist()`` of the routed expert set, which makes it CUDA-graph hostile.

The fast path is the grouped kernel family that already exists on the llama.cpp side
(``ggml/src/ggml-cuda/pxq6.cuh``: ``moe-gateup-split`` / ``moe-down`` / ``k_pxq6_gemm_grouped``,
with pxq2/3/6 sharing one policy-templated family). Porting that off ggml's ``MUL_MAT_ID``
onto this contract is the follow-on; this file is what makes that port testable end to end.
