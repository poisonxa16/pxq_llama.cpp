"""namemap.py — ggml tensor name -> HF/vLLM tensor name, and the per-policy PXQ4 allow-list.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for plan §5.4. Every name below was checked against the AWQ twin's
``model.safetensors.index.json`` and safetensors header on the DGX this session, so the target
side is FACT, not inference: ``linear_attn.in_proj_qkv``/``in_proj_z``/``in_proj_a``/
``in_proj_b``/``out_proj``/``conv1d``/``A_log``/``dt_bias``/``norm``, ``self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj``
with ``q_proj`` at [12288, 5120], ``mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj``, ``model.language_model.*``,
``lm_head.weight`` at [248320, 5120] BF16, and 333 ``model.visual.*``.

THE PROJECTIONS ARE SPLIT ON DISK AND FUSED IN THE MODULE. The fork builds
``MergedColumnParallelLinear`` for ``in_proj_qkvz`` (output_sizes [2048,2048,6144,6144],
qwen3_5.py:212-230) and ``gate_up_proj``, but the checkpoint carries the parts separately and
vLLM's ``packed_modules_mapping`` re-fuses them at load. So the converter EMITS THEM
SEPARATELY and never pre-fuses; ``HF_MODULE_OF`` exists to tell you which fused module a
separate on-disk tensor will land in, which is what the §3.1 uniformity invariant is checked
against.

THE ONE HARD REQUIREMENT THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. ``_uses_split_gdn_input_projections``
(qwen3_5.py:127-157) decides fused-vs-split GDN input projection by scanning the quant
config's ``ignore``/``ignored_layers``/``modules_to_not_convert`` for ``linear_attn.in_proj_a``
or ``linear_attn.in_proj_b``. If it returns False the 48-row ``b``/``a`` fold into
``in_proj_qkvz``, giving 12 rows/rank at TP=4 — not a multiple of 64, and the packed shard
arithmetic TRUNCATES SILENTLY. So the emitted ``quantization_config.ignore`` must always
contain both names. ``BASE_IGNORE`` below enforces that; ``build_quantization_config``
re-asserts it.

THE GDN NAME MAP IS NOT A 1:1 RENAME. THE TWO CHECKPOINTS ORDER THE 48 VALUE-HEADS
DIFFERENTLY, and a converter that only renames produces a model that loads, runs, and emits
fluent garbage. ggml lays the 48-way v-head axis out REPEAT-MAJOR (``i = n_k_heads*r + k``,
which is what a broadcast expansion of the 16 k-heads gives); HF lays it out K-HEAD-MAJOR
(``j = R*k + r`` with ``R = n_v_heads // n_k_heads = 3``, which is what
``repeat_interleave`` gives). So every per-v-head axis needs the gather

    hf[j] = ggml[ n_k_heads * (j % R) + j // R ]                   (``v_head_gather``)

applied in units of one head (the 48-entry vectors) or one 128-wide head block (the weight
matrices). MEASURED on the real artifacts, exactly, not inferred — see ``GDN_PERM_SPEC``.
The 16-way q/k head axes are IDENTICAL in the two files and must NOT be touched.

WHAT IS MEASURED AND WHAT IS STILL ASSUMED. Three mappings used to be flagged here as
inference. Two of them are now measured facts (the ``ssm_beta``/``ssm_alpha`` pairing, and the
conv1d tap order) and the third turned out to be WRONG (``ssm_a`` is not log-space); each
entry below carries its evidence. Anything still unverified is flagged ASSUMPTION.

#: Modules served by PXQ4 in P1 — exactly those that are already PXQ4 in the artifact AND are
#: uniformly PXQ4 across every output_partition_size of their fused vLLM module (§3.1).

#: P2a adds the GDN output projection. It is MXFP4 (ggml id 39) in the artifact, so it must be
#: RE-ENCODED to PXQ4 — this is the single largest decode-bandwidth lever that does not touch a
#: tensor class the backbone table deliberately protects.
PXQ4_MODULES_P2A = PXQ4_MODULES_P1 | {"linear_attn.out_proj"}

#: P2b WOULD add the LM head — and deliberately does NOT.
#:
#: ``lm_head`` IS NOT SERVABLE AS PXQ4 BY THE ENGINE SIDE OF THIS PROJECT, so the converter
#: must not encode it. The rule is owned by the quant-config component
#: (``pxq4_vllm.config.UNSERVABLE_PXQ4_LEAF_MODULES``), which now REJECTS a checkpoint whose
#: ``pxq4_modules`` names it, at ``from_config`` time. Two independent, verified blocks:
#:   1. ``VocabParallelEmbedding.__init__`` forces its own bespoke v1 vocab weight_loader
#:      (vocab_parallel_embedding.py:520-527, :633-682); ``PXQ4LinearMethod.create_weights``
#:      refuses any non-``weight_loader_v2`` loader when tp_size > 1, because v1 cannot slice
#:      the 64-row panel layout. At TP=4 that is a hard error.
#:   2. One vocab weight_loader call cannot fill the two parameters (``pxq4_slabs``,
#:      ``pxq4_anchor``) that one PXQ4 module owns.
#: Serving a 4-bit head needs a dedicated PXQ4 embedding method (plan §3, P3), not a flag.
#:
#: Emitting a PXQ4 ``lm_head`` anyway produced a checkpoint that could not be loaded at all:
#: the engine constructs the head as fp16 and then finds no ``lm_head.weight`` in the file.
#: So P2b is currently EMPTY of content — the same module set as P2a — and is BLOCKED at the
#: CLI rather than silently aliased. See ``BLOCKED_POLICIES``.
PXQ4_MODULES_P2B = frozenset(PXQ4_MODULES_P2A)

#: P2c makes ``self_attn.qkv_proj`` uniformly PXQ4 by re-encoding k/v (q8_0 in the artifact,
#: pinned there for quality by the backbone table). Only then may ``attn_q`` — which IS already
#: pxq4 on disk — finally be served, because the fused QKVParallelLinear admits no per-shard
#: dispatch (§3.1).
#:
#: ECONOMICS CORRECTION, and it matters: plan §0 scored p2c at 3.237 GiB/GPU/token (−8.7% vs
#: the incumbent AWQ's 3.547) ONLY because it counted a 4-bit LM head. With the head fp16,
#: ``bandwidth_report(build_plan(..., "p2c"), tp=4)`` — this package's own accounting, run
#: against the real artifact header — gives 3.616 GiB/GPU, of which the fp16 head is 0.592.
#: A PXQ4 head would be 0.592 × 4.254/16 = 0.157, i.e. the 0.435 GiB the plan booked as its
#: p2a→p2b delta. (The two accountings differ by ~1.7% on the same configuration; use this
#: one for this converter's output, and never mix them in a single comparison.)
#: PROJECTION, same method and assumptions as plan §0 — scale the incumbent's MEASURED 92.8
#: tok/s peak by the weight-bytes ratio, assuming our kernels sustain its effective HBM
#: bandwidth; NO GPU WAS RUN: 3.616 vs 3.547 is +1.9% bytes, so p2c as it now ships projects
#: to ≈91 tok/s. IT DOES NOT BEAT THE INCUMBENT. Nothing in this ladder does until a PXQ4
#: LM head is servable, which is why P2b is blocked rather than quietly dropped.
