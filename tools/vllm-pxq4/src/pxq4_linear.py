"""PXQ4LinearMethod -- weight declaration, TP sharding contract, and apply().

DESTINATION IN THE REPO OF PLAN 09: ``src/pxq4_vllm/linear.py``.

Component B ("runtime"), plan 09 sec.6.6.  This is where TP correctness lives.

==============================================================================
WHAT THIS CLASS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
==============================================================================
1. Declaring two parameters whose shapes and ``output_dim``/``input_dim``/
   ``packed_dim``/``packed_factor`` attributes make vLLM's *stock* v2 weight
   loaders shard a 64-row panel-interleaved format correctly, in both
   directions, with no custom loader code.  See ``parameters.py`` for the
   layout argument; this file owns the *asserts* that make a misaligned split
   impossible.
2. Refusing, loudly and early, anything it cannot serve.
3. ``apply()``: a small-M mmv kernel and a large-M dequant+cuBLAS path, both
   allocation-free and CUDA-graph-capture safe.

==============================================================================
THE MIXED-TYPE CHECKPOINT, AND WHY THIS FILE HAS NO q8_0 / q6_k / MXFP4 PATH
==============================================================================
A "PXQ4" GGUF is not uniformly PXQ4.  Backbone rev 2 (docs/LEVERS.md; gguf KV
``pxa.pxq.backbone_map``) demotes by tensor class, and the artifact really
contains five types: PXQ4(252) 325 tensors, Q8_0 132, Q6_K 1, MXFP4(39) 48,
F32 360 -- attn_k/attn_v are q8_0, token_embd is q6_k, output(lm_head) is
q8_0, ssm_out is MXFP4, norms are f32.

The chosen design (plan sec.5.3) resolves that OFFLINE: the converter emits
PXQ4 modules as ``<module>.pxq4_slabs`` + ``<module>.pxq4_anchor`` and emits
EVERY other class as a plain fp16 ``<module>.weight``.  So at serving time the
split is binary and this file only ever sees the PXQ4 half:

    config.get_quant_method(layer, prefix)
        prefix in ignore        -> UnquantizedLinearMethod   (fp16 .weight)
        prefix in pxq4_modules  -> PXQ4LinearMethod          (this file)
        otherwise               -> UnquantizedLinearMethod   (fp16 .weight)

Adding a q8_0 or MXFP4 path *here* would be strictly worse than the offline
dequant: it would need its own parameter classes, its own sharding proof, and
-- for a fused module such as ``qkv_proj``, where attn_q is PXQ4 but attn_k/v
are q8_0 -- a per-shard dispatch inside one parameter, which is the single
most likely source of a silently mis-sharded, cleanly-loading, subtly-wrong
model (plan sec.3.1).  P2c dissolves that case by re-encoding k/v instead.

What this file DOES owe the mixed-type reality is a loud failure when the
config claims a module is PXQ4 and the checkpoint disagrees.  That is the
three-part written-ness proof below -- ``_SENTINEL`` (anchor),
``_SLAB_SENTINEL_BYTE`` (slabs) and ``_LoaderCallCounter`` (whole parameter).
BOTH parameters carry a value sentinel: an anchor-only sentinel is not a proof
that the module is usable, because the slab tensor is the other half of the
weight and a checkpoint can carry one without the other (a converter namemap
typo is enough -- see the docstring of ``_LoaderCallCounter``).

Note the deliberate asymmetry: we set ``_sm70_f16_forbidden`` on PXQ4 layers
only.  fp16 layers keep the fork's TurboMind sm70 fp16 GEMM fast path
(linear.py:56-96, armed by UnquantizedLinearMethod at :408), which is faster
than torch.mm on Volta.  We must never arm it for ourselves: it reads
``layer.weight``, which a PXQ4 layer does not have.

==============================================================================
VERIFIED FACTS THIS FILE DEPENDS ON (all read in /opt/1Cat-vLLM, git 2ceb15066)
==============================================================================
* ``LinearMethodBase.create_weights`` signature: linear.py:290-313;
  ``apply``: linear.py:316-325.
* Loader version is selected BY CLASS NAME:
  ``self.quant_method.__class__.__name__ in WEIGHT_LOADER_V2_SUPPORTED``
  at ColumnParallelLinear (linear.py:697-709) and RowParallelLinear
  (linear.py:1696-1708).  The list is linear.py:193-209 and the fork exposes a
  public decorator ``register_weight_loader_v2_supported_method``
  (linear.py:212-215) -- used below, so we opt in with zero patches.
  ReplicatedLinear (linear.py:559-567) always passes the v1 loader; its v1
  body is a size assert plus a full copy (linear.py:600-604), which is
  correct for an unsharded layer, so that case is allowed explicitly.
* Column split: ``_ColumnvLLMParameter.load_column_parallel_weight``
  parameter.py:145-151 (narrow by ``self.data.shape[output_dim]``).
* Merged column split: ``load_merged_column_weight`` parameter.py:153-173,
  driven by ``MergedColumnParallelLinear.weight_loader_v2`` linear.py:1140-1205
  (``shard_offset = sum(output_sizes[:id]) // tp_size``) and, for tuple shard
  ids such as ``("in_proj_qkvz", "in_proj_qkv", (0, 1, 2))``
  (qwen3_5.py:487-493), by ``_load_fused_module_from_checkpoint``
  linear.py:1100-1138, which packing-adjusts the CHECKPOINT-side narrow too.
* QKV split: ``load_qkv_weight`` parameter.py:175-201.
* Row split: ``RowvLLMParameter.load_row_parallel_weight`` parameter.py:220-230
  -- narrows ``input_dim`` and never consults ``packed_factor``.
* Full copy for a param with no ``input_dim``: ``BasevLLMParameter.
  _assert_and_load`` parameter.py:92-103.
* THE SILENT TRUNCATION: ``_adjust_shard_indexes_for_packing``
  parameter.py:605-616 -- ``round(x // packed_factor)``, no raise.
* sm70 fp16 bypass ordering: ``_maybe_sm70_dense_forward`` linear.py:56-96,
  called BEFORE ``quant_method.apply`` at linear.py:612, :805, :1794.
  Gate order: ``_sm70_f16_forbidden`` (:61) then ``_sm70_f16_prepared`` (:63).
* ``set_weight_attrs`` asserts the attribute does not already exist
  (utils.py:28-29) -- hence the filtered copy below.
* ``process_weights_after_loading`` runs for every module after the whole model
  is loaded and before compile/capture (model_loader/utils.py:99-111), inside
  ``device_loading_context``, so params are on the target device there.
* THE LOADER DOES NOT BACKSTOP US.  An earlier revision of this file claimed
  "unloaded whole parameters are already caught by the loader
  (default_loader.py:432-437)".  That is FALSE for this deployment, twice over,
  and every check in this file must be read as the ONLY line of defence:
    - default_loader.py:403-412 arms the strict check only for UNQUANTIZED
      models: ``default_enable_weights_track = (model_config.quantization is
      None and loaded_weights is not None)``.  We run ``quantization="pxq4"``,
      so ``track_weights_loading`` is never called at all.
    - even forced on via ``enable_weights_track``, track_weights_loading
      (default_loader.py:421-431) does
      ``has_postprocess_quant = getattr(quant_method,
      "process_weights_after_loading", None)`` and, when truthy, ADDS every
      parameter of that module to ``loaded_weights`` -- i.e. exempts it.
      ``QuantizeMethodBase.process_weights_after_loading`` is defined on the
      base class (base_config.py:50-55), so the attribute is truthy for EVERY
      quant method, ours included.  Every linear layer is exempt by
      construction.
  Nor does the model backstop us: qwen3_5.py:564 (``if name not in
  params_dict: continue``, inside the stacked_params_mapping loop) drops a
  mis-named checkpoint tensor, and the fallthrough at qwen3_5.py:641-646 only
  ``logger.warning_once``.  Nothing raises.
