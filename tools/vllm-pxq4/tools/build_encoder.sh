# Build libpxq4_encode.so — the native PXQ4 encoder behind converter policies p2a/p2c.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: gguf_to_vllm/encoder.py binds a frozen C ABI by ctypes, but nothing in
# this repo built it, so every P2 policy raised SystemExit at planning time. P1 does not
# need it (P1 only moves bytes that are already PXQ4); P2 does, because it re-encodes
# tensors that are NOT PXQ4 in the artifact.
#
# The implementation is a file-static function in the ENGINE tree, not here. We #include the
# .inc.cpp so the static symbol is visible in our translation unit rather than vendoring a
# copy that would silently drift from the engine.

# usage: build_encoder.sh [MGV_SRC] [OUT]
