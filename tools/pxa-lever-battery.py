"""launcher-levers.py - exercise every CLI lever pxa-launch.py accepts, against real
hardware, and check the ONE property the launcher promises about all of them.

WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM --selftest
  --selftest drives the DECISION TABLE with synthetic model facts. It never parses an
  argv, never resolves a real model, and never emits a command. So it proves the routing
  logic and proves nothing about the flags. Every lever below is reachable only through
  argparse and the command builder, which --selftest does not touch.

THE PROPERTY
  pxa-launch's stated design rule is: "REFUSES rather than silently dropping a parameter
  that does not translate." That makes one outcome, and only one, a defect:

    PASSED      the flag reached the emitted command             ok
    REFUSED     the launcher stopped and named a refusal code    ok
    ANNOUNCED   not passed, but the output says so and why       ok
    DROPPED     accepted, absent from the command, never
                mentioned again                                  DEFECT

  A DROPPED lever is the worst failure mode this launcher can have, because the operator
  gets a seat that silently ignores what they asked for and every later measurement is
  attributed to a configuration that was never applied.
